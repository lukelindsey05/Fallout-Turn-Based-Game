## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project is a game that you can make decisions and those decisions will effect your choices later on in the game.
Basically an attempt at a game that will have choices that will influence an outcome.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
It will be a story game that will let your choices effect that outcome of your story. I will use renpy.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A basic story were some of your choices effect the outcome.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A game that involves chance and choice that effects the outcome.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A in depth story where each event changes the ending of your story slightly so every choice will have an effect on the story.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step is to learn how to use renpy and figure how to implement an element of chance that runs in the background
and an element of choice that both effect the end of the story.  I also want to try to implement some background pictures that
relate to the choices also a fallout like text ui that allows you to pick your option.
